## General info
This is a react native marketplace app. Furthermore, the app is integrated with Firebase Authorization service to handle secure client login. Similarly to my other projects this required me to read through documentation and solve my own problems as they arose. This project shows I am interested in many different types of front end technologies and am constantly pushing myself to learn more.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
